#Pozol_Metagenome

Pozol is a mexican traditional beverage made from nixtamal fermented dough resuspended in water. It is the product of a spontaneous fermentation and it has a complex microbiota. This project WGS analysis of metagenomic samples of four key times of the fermentation (0,9,24 and 48 hours of fermentation).
The expectation is that the results of this study contribute to our understanding of the metabolic potential of microorganisms in this traditional beverage.

This work was carried out at the Biotechnology Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, in the Celular Engineer and Biocatalysis Department laboratory led by Dr. Lorenzo P. Segovia Forcella.

All analysis were done on the "FOS" and "Teopanzolco" servers of the Biotechnology Insittute of UNAM.
